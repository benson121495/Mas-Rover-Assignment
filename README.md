# Mas-Rover-Assignment


# Introduction

I am setting up a application that to set up a Grid in Mars By a Plateau.

We will input the direction and the GriD to walk around in Mars

# approaches

I use global variable to storage the location 
The main Program will get those input function then assign to different command to process each action
Then return to the main program

# future thoughts
I think I will be transform to console input or transfer to GUI program to input , that can be draw a small diagram that can show the actual location where are you going or staying.

# The step
Step 1 , input the Grid  ' System will save it in the global varibal "Grid' 

Step 2 , input the starting point . System will save the starting point with in The Grid Location

Step 3 , input the direction and the moven point

Step 4 ,  system will cal the location turn direction

step 5 , system will return the result



`mars.ts` is the first page with the start point 

`mars.test.ts` is the TDD Testing Program 


# moveCommand folder
storage all off the command like turning move forward on it.

each file will be handle different command.

# globalValue folder 
storage different reuseable variable
